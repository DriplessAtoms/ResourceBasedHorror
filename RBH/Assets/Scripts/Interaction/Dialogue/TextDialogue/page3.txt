Unknown:Day 19: We got a notification from the police. They went to his apartment and he wasn’t there.
Unknown:They asked relatives and there was still no sign of him. The last place he was seen was here, at the warehouse.
Unknown:Apparently he sneaked into the other part of the warehouse that isn't really used that much, Even though I’m a manager I don't have access to that half of the warehouse.
