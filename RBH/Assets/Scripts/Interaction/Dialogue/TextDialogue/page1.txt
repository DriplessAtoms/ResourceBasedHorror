Unknown:Day 1: Started this job yesterday, I am a Floor Manager, I look after the deliveries inbound or outbound.
Unknown:The upper management wanted me to keep a diary of what happened everyday so here we are. Everything went smoothly for the first day, all the deliveries came in and were shipped out on time.
Unknown:All the workers seemed like hard working guys. Think this will be a good place to work.
