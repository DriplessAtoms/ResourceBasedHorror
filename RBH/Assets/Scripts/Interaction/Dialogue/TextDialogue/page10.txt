Unknown:Day 66: Nononononono, they're here in my brain. I feel it all. I see it all. They're summoning them. The company is behind all of this.
Unknown:They want to bring hell to Earth. They think that we are fools. No. We are going to stop this.
Unknown:We are capable, we will burn that damned place down. I will become a caged animal and I will still seek its destruction.
Unknown:I am sure of it. I'm going in there and stopping it all. I will be this world's salvation and I will stop it.
