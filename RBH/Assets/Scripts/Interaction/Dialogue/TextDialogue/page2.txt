Unknown:Day 17: one of my employees just disappeared a couple of days ago. Seemed like a nice guy.
Unknown:Got along with his coworkers and did his job very well, but he hasn't shown up 2 days in a row.
Unknown:He didn't have scheduled time off or has contacted anyone about an emergency, I think someone in HR is going to call for a wellness check on him.
Unknown:Hope the guy is okay.
