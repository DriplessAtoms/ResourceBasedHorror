Unknown:Day 25: they found the guy's body. It was out back, near the logging area. His body was mangled beyond recognition.
Unknown:The only way they could identify him was his driver's licence. His half if Abonmen was missing. Theyâ€™re saying a bear must've attacked him.
Unknown:My guys have been hearing noises when doing night shifts, but they sound like a rabbit screeching. We haven't seen a bear since but we're keeping an eye out.
