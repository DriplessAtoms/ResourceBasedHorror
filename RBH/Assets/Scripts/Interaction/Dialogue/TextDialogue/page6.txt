Unknown:Day 45: I was working night shift again and saw someone walking in the loading yard, it looked like a person but the midsection was flared out.
Unknown:It didn't seem like they had any arms, I tried calling out to them but they ignored me.
Unknown:I just put in down to me having a lack of sleep over the past few days, I need to get more sleep or I'm gonna start seeing things again.
