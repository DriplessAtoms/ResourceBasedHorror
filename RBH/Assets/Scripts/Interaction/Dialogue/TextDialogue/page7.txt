Unknown:Day 58: There's been more activity in the other part of the warehouse, I'm seeing more people come and go, I don’t know what's going on and everytime I ask.
Unknown:I get a no-answer from the higher ups, I’m thinking about putting in my 2 weeks notice but my rent is due and the company hasn’t reimbursed me yet for having to relocate for this job.
Unknown:My guys are also talking about some buzzing from the back of the warehouse as well.
Unknown:I swear if we have wasps or hornets along with whatever the fuck we currently have going on, then I might just quit.
